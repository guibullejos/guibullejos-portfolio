                  <br> <br> Reflections about essential aspects of my professional identity.
                  <br> <br> I always love to present myself by this model series I have made in 2015. Although it is very old, they keep up with five aspects (memories, acquirements, collaboration, void, balance) of my professional identity.
                  <br> <br> Memory:
                  <br> (1st image in the left column)
                  <br>Since each human involved in the creative process has it own background, their collaboration is unique, because their memories are unique. making every point of view matter.

                  Collaboration:
                  <br> (2nd image in the left column)
                  <br>When all points of view complete each other we extremely realize how much the team effort and the sharing of knowledge are fundamental to the development of creative projects.
                  <br> <br>Balance: 
                  <br>(3rd image in the left column)
                  <br>There is a obligation of finding the balance between what already exists with what is supposed to be created.
                  <br> <br>Void:
                  <br> (1st image in the right column)
                  <br>Even if a creative project tries to be self-reliance, there is always a void that will be fulfilled by the viewer. That's why we can't foresee the individual singularities of the perception and totally predict it. And this is amazing.
                  <br> <br>Acquirements: 
                  <br>(2nd image in the right column)
                  <br>Even though we receive lots of information' clusters, we can only improve by mixing, combining, separating, counterposing, organizing them to develop new kinds of knowledge.

                <br> <br>It was a volunteer project which Spaces&Creatures has participated bringing its processes and human resources to the project. This project had a fast growth in less than 1 week, what made it very challenging to deal with lots of volunteers and the incoming histories. The great team effort and organization made it very possible and a remarkable project to the ones who lost their beloved ones.

                Micro-ecologies is a series of four interactive art installations which was born from an extensive personal and scientific research about the mapping of spatial impacts in my identity formation process.
                <br> <br> From the concept of mapping the encounters between the body+mind and the space around us, I created four interactive installation (city, forest, prairie and mangroove) based on the same system of construction I used on the spybarn. These installations came from an internal mapping of myself and, when I externalised them, I don't assume they are a conclusion, but a collective experience.
                <br> <br> Each of them were precisely designed. Each material, each texture, each sensor and each atuador have a meaning.

              The Museum of the City of São Paulo is a network of historical buildings dated from the 17th and 20th centuries and spread around the city. They represent remnants of the rural and urban occupation of São Paulo.
              <br> <br> The team was formed with people from several nationality and backgrounds. During a workshop we were  challenged to develop a project to the Museum of the City of São Paulo. After we understood the context of it, we proposed a systematic intervention that could make the museum more notable and accessible.
              <br> <br> Team: Anya Lawson, Chastine Bagge, Débora Taboada, Guilherme Bullejos, Hellen Oliveira, João Guirau, Nívea Pascoaloto

              As they represent the memory, we designed a set of alike modules that composed the installation which could represent the memory in our thoughts.
              <br> <br>As a memory that lights our ideas, the installation would bright when someone crossed it by detecting their presence and revealing new information to the passerby.
              <br> <br>The object would work as a display for people getting in touch with each of the Museum of the City of São Paulo's 13 buildings. That's why were would be a set of 13 pieces composing the whole installation.

                <br> <br> Based on 3 tales, these project is composed by 3 houses which talks about the relation between the human and the time in a spatial way, showing the intrinsic relation of the humanity with the past, the present and the future. Besides the architectural drawings generated parametrically, the whole process peaked in 3 models composed by unusual materials for making architectural models like plaster, granite and argil.

From these 3 tales I elaborated 3 characters; one for each context; looking for delineate each different vision of the time so that the space reveals this reverberations.

                <br> <br> A temporary shelter created to compose - with other shelters - a village built from wasted materials.
                <br> <br> Born from the concept of a barn to trojan horses of a village, conceptually the project intents to parasite other shelters and corrupt their notion of privacy protection.

                Soft toys of wild animals were adapted to look like farming animals which were distributed to the village as a gift to the people harmony. A hidden camera on these animals would broadcast the intimacy of the villagers in the transparent skin of the shelter during the night.
                <br> <br> This work emerged from a group effort, which had it bases on the practical and easy assembling system. Since it took few hours to build, we could expose the construction to few environments and improve the resistance of it.

                <br> <br>This urban installation was created based on the series of loneliness. This intervention happened in an underused space beside the Den Haag Central Station and assumes that the differences of each passerby can be crossed during their paths establishing common points which can grow as groups that share the same differences - a community.

                From this point of view, I designed an intervention which circles the space and creates several shapes in the space inviting people to populate and appropriate this huge ring shaped sculpture that intends to create a communal space in the urban context. Highlighting the intention, I projected a student house bar crossed by the sculpture to organize and intensify the use of this public space.

              <br> <br>Loneliness is a challenging theme in global cities. How is it possible to live in a city with millions and yet feel lonely?
              <br> <br>This series of model intends to answer this using the scale's perception starting from the global to the individual notions resulting a strategic approach to deal with it

              <br>(2nd image in the left column)
              <br>It's about the heavy and strong hierarch built in society which tries to suppress people by not giving them wide space to express themselves.

              <br>(3rd image in the left column)
              <br>Each person has its personal empires enclosed by walls. Inside these walls  there is a world designed to safety of its true-self; a lonely safe haven.

              <br>(4th image in the left column)
              <br>It's about the strange atmosphere which hover in the city and somehow force people to cover their vulnerabilities and differences in order to fit in society.

              <br>(the image in the right column)
              <br> The first step to deal with loneliness in the urban context is to tear down the barriers between everyone. As a horizontal movement, an intervention allowing humans to co-sharing, exchanging information, knowledges, skills and experiences apart from their differences and similarities.

                <br> <br>We are constantly receiving information and very often we are saturated of them. The limitless amount of information we perceived can be overwhelming to the limited body. That's why lots of things we automatize. We lose the details.
                <br> <br>Communal cave invites us to recall the details. Entering through three dark corridors that leads to its core that has timered flashing lights. The visitors, which haven't never seen each other, now are invited to pay attention to recognize their fellows inhabitants between the flashes.

                <br> <br>This installation came from my inquiries and explorations about space as a meanning of introspection and navigation through mental maps. So I created a space of introspection that is aiming at users entering into themselves and navigating the entire universe created in their innermost parts. It's a small and simple individual installation that would provide a space of introspection to the users.
                <br> <br>The form, materiality and elements of the composition seek to establish an atmosphere where users feel welcome to go into a reflection where they are able to navigate their own mental maps reliving and rethinking all their connections with themselves and with the world. Involved by space, individuals are invited to have a deep experience in which they give themselves as a sacrifice in order to transcend to a deep self knowledge.
